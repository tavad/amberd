{{% pageinfo %}}
This is a placeholder page that shows you how to use this template site.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

This section is where the user documentation for your project lives - all the
information your users need to understand and successfully use your project.

For large documentation sets we recommend adding content under the headings in
this section, though if some or all of them don’t apply to your project feel
free to remove them or add your own. You can see an example of a smaller Docsy
documentation site in the [Docsy User Guide](https://docsy.dev/docs/), which
lives in the [Docsy theme
repo](https://github.com/google/docsy/tree/master/userguide) if you'd like to
copy its docs section.

Other content such as marketing material, case studies, and community updates
should live in the [About](/about/) and [Community](/community/) pages.

Find out how to use the Docsy theme in the [Docsy User
Guide](https://docsy.dev/docs/). You can learn more about how to organize your
documentation (and how we organized this site) in [Organizing Your
Content](https://docsy.dev/docs/best-practices/organizing-content/).

**This is a typical blog post that includes images.**

The front matter specifies the date of the blog post, its title, a short description that will be displayed on the blog landing page, and its author.

## Including images

Here's an image (`featured-sunset-get.png`) that includes a byline and a caption.

{{< imgproc sunset Fill "600x300" >}}
Fetch and scale an image in the upcoming Hugo 0.43.
{{< /imgproc >}}

The front matter of this post specifies properties to be assigned to all image resources:

```
resources:
- src: "**.{png,jpg}"
  title: "Image #:counter"
  params:
    byline: "Photo: Riona MacNamara / CC-BY-CA"
```

To include the image in a page, specify its details like this:

```
{{< imgproc sunset Fill "600x300" >}}
Fetch and scale an image in the upcoming Hugo 0.43.
{{< /imgproc >}}
```

The image will be rendered at the size and byline specified in the front matter.

## First Header

This is a normal paragraph following a header. Bacon ipsum dolor sit amet t-bone doner shank drumstick, pork belly porchetta chuck sausage brisket ham hock rump pig. Chuck kielbasa leberkas, pork bresaola ham hock filet mignon cow shoulder short ribs biltong.  Bacon ipsum dolor sit amet t-bone doner shank drumstick, pork belly porchetta chuck sausage brisket ham hock rump pig. Chuck kielbasa leberkas, pork bresaola ham hock filet mignon cow shoulder short ribs biltong.  Bacon ipsum dolor sit amet t-bone doner shank drumstick, pork belly porchetta chuck sausage brisket ham hock rump pig. Chuck kielbasa leberkas, pork bresaola ham hock filet mignon cow shoulder short ribs biltong.



Bacon ipsum dolor sit amet t-bone doner shank drumstick, pork belly porchetta chuck sausage brisket ham hock rump pig. Chuck kielbasa leberkas, pork bresaola ham hock filet mignon cow shoulder short ribs biltong.

On big screens, paragraphs and headings should not take up the full container width, but we want tables, code blocks and similar to take the full width.

Lorem markdownum tuta hospes stabat; idem saxum facit quaterque repetito
occumbere, oves novem gestit haerebat frena; qui. Respicit recurvam erat:
pignora hinc reppulit nos **aut**, aptos, ipsa.

Meae optatos *passa est* Epiros utiliter *Talibus niveis*, hoc lata, edidit.
Dixi ad aestum.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header. Bacon ipsum dolor sit amet t-bone doner shank drumstick, pork belly porchetta chuck sausage brisket ham hock rump pig. Chuck kielbasa leberkas, pork bresaola ham hock filet mignon cow shoulder short ribs biltong.

###### Header 6

| What      | Follows         |
|-----------|-----------------|
| A table   | A header        |
| A table   | A header        |
| A table   | A header        |

----------------

There's a horizontal rule above and below this.

----------------

Here is an unordered list:

* Salt-n-Pepa
* Bel Biv DeVoe
* Kid 'N Play

And an ordered list:

1. Michael Jackson
2. Michael Bolton
3. Michael Bublé

And an unordered task list:

- [x] Create a sample markdown document
- [x] Add task lists to it
- [ ] Take a vacation

And a "mixed" task list:

- [ ] Steal underpants
- ?
- [ ] Profit!

And a nested list:

* Jackson 5
  * Michael
  * Tito
  * Jackie
  * Marlon
  * Jermaine
* TMNT
  * Leonardo
  * Michelangelo
  * Donatello
  * Raphael

Definition lists can be used with Markdown syntax. Definition terms are bold.

Name
: Godzilla

Born
: 1952

Birthplace
: Japan

Color
: Green


----------------

Tables should have bold headings and alternating shaded rows.

| Artist            | Album           | Year |
|-------------------|-----------------|------|
| Michael Jackson   | Thriller        | 1982 |
| Prince            | Purple Rain     | 1984 |
| Beastie Boys      | License to Ill  | 1986 |

If a table is too wide, it should scroll horizontally.

| Artist            | Album           | Year | Label       | Awards   | Songs     |
|-------------------|-----------------|------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| Michael Jackson   | Thriller        | 1982 | Epic Records | Grammy Award for Album of the Year, American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Album, American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Album, Brit Award for Best Selling Album, Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical | Wanna Be Startin' Somethin', Baby Be Mine, The Girl Is Mine, Thriller, Beat It, Billie Jean, Human Nature, P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing), The Lady in My Life |
| Prince            | Purple Rain     | 1984 | Warner Brothers Records | Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media, American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Album, American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Album, Brit Award for Best Soundtrack/Cast Recording, Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal | Let's Go Crazy, Take Me With U, The Beautiful Ones, Computer Blue, Darling Nikki, When Doves Cry, I Would Die 4 U, Baby I'm a Star, Purple Rain |

----------------

Code snippets like `var foo = "bar";` can be shown inline.

Also, `this should vertically align` ~~`with this`~~ ~~and this~~.

Code can also be shown in a block element.

```
foo := "bar";
bar := "foo";
```

Code can also use syntax highlighting.

```go
func main() {
  input := `var foo = "bar";`

  lexer := lexers.Get("javascript")
  iterator, _ := lexer.Tokenise(nil, input)
  style := styles.Get("github")
  formatter := html.New(html.WithLineNumbers())

  var buff bytes.Buffer
  formatter.Format(&buff, style, iterator)

  fmt.Println(buff.String())
}
```

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

Inline code inside table cells should still be distinguishable.

| Language    | Code               |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Javascript  | `var foo = "bar";` |
| Ruby        | `foo = "bar"{`      |

----------------

Small images should be shown at their actual size.

![](https://placekitten.com/g/300/200/)

Large images should always scale down and fit in the content container.

![](https://placekitten.com/g/1200/800/)

Code snippets like `var foo = "bar";` can be shown inline.

Also, `this should vertically align` ~~`with this`~~ ~~and this~~.

Code can also be shown in a block element.

```
foo := "bar";
bar := "foo";
```

Code can also use syntax highlighting.

```go
func main() {
  input := `var foo = "bar";`

  lexer := lexers.Get("javascript")
  iterator, _ := lexer.Tokenise(nil, input)
  style := styles.Get("github")
  formatter := html.New(html.WithLineNumbers())

  var buff bytes.Buffer
  formatter.Format(&buff, style, iterator)

  fmt.Println(buff.String())
}
```

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

Inline code inside table cells should still be distinguishable.

These basic sample guidelines assume that your Docsy site is deployed using Netlify and your files are stored in GitHub. You can use the guidelines "as is" or adapt them with your own instructions: for example, other deployment options, information about your doc project's file structure, project-specific review guidelines, versioning guidelines, or any other information your users might find useful when updating your site. [Kubeflow](https://github.com/kubeflow/website/blob/master/README.md) has a great example.

Don't forget to link to your own doc repo rather than our example site! Also make sure users can find these guidelines from your doc repo README: either add them there and link to them from this page, add them here and link to them from the README, or include them in both locations.

{{% /pageinfo %}}

We use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to format and generate our website, the
[Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme for styling and site structure,
and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to manage the deployment of the site.
Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates,
content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation
engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Quick start with Netlify

Here's a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you're familiar with the
GitHub workflow and you're happy to use the automated preview of your doc
updates:

1. Fork the [Goldydocs repo](https://github.com/google/docsy-example) on GitHub.
1. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR).
1. If you're not yet ready for a review, add "WIP" to the PR name to indicate
  it's a work in progress. (**Don't** add the Hugo property
  "draft = true" to the page front matter, because that prevents the
  auto-deployment of the content preview described in the next point.)
1. Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it's ready,
  you should see a comment like this: **deploy/netlify — Deploy preview ready!**
1. Click **Details** to the right of "Deploy preview ready" to see a preview
  of your updates.
1. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you're happy with
  the content.
1. When you're ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any
  "WIP" markers.

## Updating a single page

If you've just spotted something you'd like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:

1. Click **Edit this page** in the top right hand corner of the page.
1. If you don't already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click **Fork this repository and propose changes** or **Update your Fork** to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode.
1. Follow the rest of the [Quick start with Netlify](#quick-start-with-netlify) process above to make, preview, and propose your changes.

## Previewing your changes locally

If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:

1. Follow the instructions in [Getting started](/docs/getting-started) to install Hugo and any other tools you need. You'll need at least **Hugo version 0.45** (we recommend using the most recent available version), and it must be the **extended** version, which supports SCSS.
1. Fork the [Goldydocs repo](https://github.com/google/docsy-example) repo into your own project, then create a local copy using `git clone`. Don’t forget to use `--recurse-submodules` or you won’t pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.

    ```
    git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git
    ```

1. Run `hugo server` in the site root directory. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. Now that you're serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.
1. Continue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the
  changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.

## Creating an issue

If you've found a problem in the docs, but you're not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the [Goldydocs repo](https://github.com/google/docsy-example/issues). You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the **Create Issue** button in the top right hand corner of the page.

This is a placeholder page that shows you how to use this template site.

{{% /pageinfo %}}

For many projects, users may not need much information beyond the information in the [Overview](/docs/overview/), so this section is **optional**. However if there are areas where your users will need a more detailed understanding of a given term or feature in order to do anything useful with your project (or to not make mistakes when using it) put that information in this section. For example, you may want to add some conceptual pages if you have a large project with many components and a complex architecture.

Remember to focus on what the user needs to know, not just what you think is interesting about your project! If they don’t need to understand your original design decisions to use or contribute to the project, don’t put them in, or include your design docs in your repo and link to them. Similarly, most users will probably need to know more about how features work when in use rather than how they are implemented. Consider a separate architecture page for more detailed implementation and system design information that potential project contributors can consult.

For large documentation sets we recommend adding content under the headings in
this section, though if some or all of them don’t apply to your project feel
free to remove them or add your own. You can see an example of a smaller Docsy
documentation site in the [Docsy User Guide](https://docsy.dev/docs/), which
lives in the [Docsy theme

{{% pageinfo %}}

This is a placeholder page that shows you how to use this template site.

{{% /pageinfo %}}

The Overview is where your users find out about your project. Depending on the
size of your docset, you can have a separate overview page (like this one) or
put your overview contents in the Documentation landing page (like in the Docsy
User Guide).

Try answering these questions for your user in this page:

## What is it?

Introduce your project, including what it does or lets you do, why you would use
it, and its primary goal (and how it achieves it). This should be similar to
your README description, though you can go into a little more detail here if you
want.

## Why do I want it?

Help your user know if your project will help them. Useful information can
include:

- **What is it good for?**: What types of problems does your project solve? What
  are the benefits of using it?

- **What is it not good for?**: For example, point out situations that might
  intuitively seem suited for your project, but aren't for some reason. Also
  mention known limitations, scaling issues, or anything else that might let
  your users know if the project is not for them.

- **What is it _not yet_ good for?**: Highlight any useful features that are
  coming soon.

## Where should I go next?

Give your users next steps from the Overview. For example:

- [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/): Get started with $project
- [Examples](/docs/examples/): Check out some example code!

### Numbers Don't Lie

Trends in public finance are critically important for sustainable state development. When any organization, especially a state, chronically underperforms in planned revenue collection, it indicates systemic management issues.

These trends require special attention and comprehensive analysis. Over the past 15 years, Armenia hasn't recorded three consecutive quarters where tax collections were consistently below 7%, as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1

![Plot 1 Budget Performance](plots/plot_1_budget_performance.png)

Tax revenues, being the main source of state budget collection, are of paramount importance. When the state receives less income than planned, the likelihood of crisis phenomena increases significantly.

The situation in 2024 is particularly concerning, as it shows significant tax under-collection. This phenomenon is not due to failures of the State Revenue Committee (SRC) but rather results from ineffective fiscal policy.

This situation led to significant changes in the government composition on October 18, including the resignation of the SRC chairman.

It's worth noting that since 2018, tax collection growth has become the main performance indicator of the current government's effectiveness, which in the current economic situation has become an end in itself. From 2018 to 2023, tax revenues grew by an average of 15.6% annually. However, there is currently a clear issue of tax revenue underperformance.

It's important to emphasize that this situation is not due to SRC failures. Moreover, since tax collection is one of the government's key performance indicators, it directly determines the volume of bonuses.

To address the tax revenue shortfall, the government has recently undertaken several measures - tightening tax collection, introducing new taxes and fees, eliminating existing tax benefits, and increasing certain tax rates.

These measures include, for example, discussions about double taxation of mortgage loan income tax returns and doubling the turnover tax rate from 5% to 10% from the beginning of 2025. It is also planned to terminate tax benefits for the IT sector from the beginning of 2025.

Within this policy framework, the government's rhetoric has also formed, according to which the tax collector is a "hero" who should be toasted.

It is undeniable that tax collection is the cornerstone of state operations, without which normal state functioning is impossible. Tax revenues, being the main source of the state budget, ensure funding for education, healthcare, defense, and social services.

However, as already mentioned, the current problems are not due to SRC operational failures but rather ineffective implementation of fiscal policy.

Currently, there are several fundamental problems in the economy, which have been analyzed in detail in our [tvyal.com publications](https://www.tvyal.com/newsletter). These include [the decrease in real export volumes](https://www.tvyal.com/newsletter/2024/2024_09_02), [economic growth dependence on gold re-exports from Russia](https://www.tvyal.com/newsletter/2024/2024_09_02), [reduction in registered organizations](https://www.tvyal.com/newsletter/2024/2024_10_14), [significant capital outflow](https://www.tvyal.com/newsletter/2024/2024_09_16), [decline in tourism](https://www.tvyal.com/newsletter/2024/2024_06_17), and [negative trends in the IT sector](https://www.tvyal.com/newsletter/2024/2024_08_19).

Among these systemic issues, [the reduction in tax collection volumes](https://www.tvyal.com/newsletter/2024/2024_08_02) is notable, mainly expressed through decreases in VAT and profit tax. This directly indicates a decline in the number of transactions in the real economy and organizations' profitability. In other words, there is a significant reduction in trade turnover volumes.

Under such conditions, it is unrealistic to expect additional tax revenues from citizens and economic entities. Such a policy could lead to the opposite result. Under conditions of real economy contraction and increased tax burden, economic entities may resort to various solutions - relocating to other countries (especially in the IT sector), facing bankruptcy, or moving into the shadow economy.

Tax revenue underperformance is a serious economic indicator, not just a statistical deviation. During the first nine months of the current year, the shortfall in planned tax revenues amounted to about 8 percent or 150 billion drams. Notably, this underperformance was recorded despite economic growth of around 6 percent.

The 12.6% economic growth recorded in Armenia in 2022 was mainly an indirect consequence of sanctions against Russia. As a result of this situation, significant capital and human resources moved to Armenia from Russia, especially from the IT sector.

In 2022, the banking system's net profitability recorded almost triple growth, thanks to which the IT and banking sectors together provided approximately half of the annual 12.6% economic growth. However, this phenomenon was temporary and began to significantly fade from mid-2023. Moreover, capital began to move in the opposite direction, flowing out of the country, which poses a serious challenge for our economy that is heavily dependent on external financing.

From November 2023, however, another short-term economic phenomenon emerged - significant re-export of gold and diamonds from Russia to Greater China and the UAE. This process contributed to the 8.3% economic growth in 2023, providing about 2 percentage points of it.

In our previous research, we have already noted that in the first half of 2024, [72% of Armenia's export structure consisted of precious stones and metals re-export](https://www.tvyal.com/newsletter/2024/2024_07_05), an unprecedented figure. This indicator effectively masked the decline in exports of all other product groups and downward trends in the real economy. During this period, gold re-export operations and trade transactions were the main driving forces of Armenia's economic growth.

However, this phenomenon, being conditioned by external factors of a short-term nature, has already started showing signs of decline since May 2024. In the current situation, the economy lacks a stable internal source of growth that could guarantee the government's targeted desired annual 7% economic growth.

Under such conditions, the unreasonably high economic growth forecasts underlying the budget contain significant risks and could lead to crisis phenomena in the form of decreased tax revenues and increased public debt, signs of which are already visible.

It is noteworthy that the government has already begun to realize the seriousness of these problems, which we have been voicing for more than two years, and has projected a more moderate growth rate of 5.4% in the 2025 budget. However, even this relatively restrained forecast appears overly optimistic in the current situation.

Armenia's economy's long-term average growth rate is 4.5%. Any system, without significant qualitative changes, tends to return to its long-term average indicators.

Currently, Armenia's economic growth is predominantly conditioned by short-term external factors emanating from Russia, which, however, cannot serve as a basis for long-term sustainable internal economic growth.

The situation is also complicated chronologically. Armenia's economic growth indicators, especially the 12.6% in 2022, have created extremely optimistic assessments, even claims about an "economic miracle." However, as in-depth analysis shows, behind this apparent success lies a significantly more complex and concerning reality.

Figure 2

![Plot 2 Income Taxes](plots/plot_2_income_taxes.png)

The second figure shows the performance of Armenia's state budget revenues and expenditures relative to planned indicators. As the data shows, the budget's expenditure part shows an underperformance trend until year-end, when the main part of expenditures is implemented. In this context, particularly problematic were the years when significant underperformance was recorded in year-end tax revenues.

To provide a clear assessment of the government programs' effectiveness, it is necessary to wait for the final expenditure figures at year-end. However, some concerning trends are already visible, particularly in the IT sector, which will be detailed in the next section.

For the first 9 months, total state budget expenditure underperformance was approximately 13% or 290 billion drams. More concerning is the 30% or 124 billion dram underperformance in capital expenditures (school construction, reservoir construction, road construction, etc.). The Ministry of Economy's economic support programs underperformed by 26%, mainly due to low performance in investment, export promotion, and agricultural sector programs.

Notably, after a long-term decline in the agricultural sector, slight growth was recorded during the first nine months of the current year. Meanwhile, without accounting for Russian gold re-export operations, the industrial sector also recorded almost zero growth. More concerning is the 8.5% decline in the information and communication sector, as well as the 13% decline recorded in the information technology sector.

Under these conditions, the risk of public debt growth increases significantly. According to current fiscal rules, when Government debt exceeds 60% of GDP, the executive body is obligated to limit current expenditures and present a clear debt reduction program. The Ministry of Finance aims to maintain the public debt/GDP ratio within 50% in its medium-term policy framework. However, with budget underperformance, economic growth slowdown, and possible AMD depreciation, there is a serious risk that the public debt/GDP ratio could exceed the 60% threshold. Under current trends, the probability of this scenario is sensitive.

### IT Sector Underperformance

Table 1

<iframe src="plots/gt_table_hightech_performance.html" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

Perhaps nowhere are the problems between economies more evident than in Armenia's technology sector. This sector was declared as the country's strategic branch for sustainable growth. Currently, the IT sector shows concerning signs. The Ministry of High-Tech Industry has managed to implement only 58.4% of its planned budget, significantly underperforming, which also raises concerns about this sector's health. These sector problems were also decoded in our latest research [🆘🇦🇲🧑🏼‍💻 SOS Armenian IT: From Strategic Priority to Potential Decline](https://www.tvyal.com/newsletter/2024/2024_08_19).

The numbers tell a not-so-positive story. According to official data, the Ministry's total expenditures amounted to only 7.8 billion drams - half of planned expenditures. For a sector that should be the driving force of Armenia's economic future, this is quite a telling indicator, more than just budget statistics. This also indicates strategic regression in the sector.

Recent data shows that the IT sector has recorded negative growth over the last three quarters, which may indicate a crisis in this strategic sector. The upturn that began in 2022, mainly driven by the influx of specialists from Russia, has started to fade. Although the number of registered IT companies in Armenia has sharply decreased, the number of foreign-registered but Armenia-operating IT companies has shown interesting growth. However, this shift doesn't correspond with employee numbers, suggesting data inaccuracy or mass closure of small businesses.

This decline is caused by several factors, including AMD appreciation, tax policy changes, high cost of living in Yerevan, and ineffective fiscal policy. Currency strengthening has particularly negatively affected export-oriented sectors like IT. Additionally, the termination of tax benefits for IT companies and possible doubling of turnover tax for small and medium enterprises makes neighboring countries like Georgia more attractive for IT business. The situation is further complicated by capital outflow and reduced inflow. As Armenia's IT sector approaches a crucial phase, reviewing development strategies, reconsidering tax policy, and exploring opportunities to create new IT centers outside Yerevan becomes urgent to maintain the sector's competitiveness and growth.

In conclusion, Armenia's economy faces complex and multilayered challenges. Tax revenue underperformance, budget expenditure underperformance, IT sector decline, and dependence on external factors create serious risks for long-term sustainable development. Without systemic reforms and economic policy revision, talks about an "economic miracle" could transform into a real threat of economic crisis. Particularly important is the revision of fiscal policy, development of a new IT sector strategy, and economic diversification to reduce dependence on temporary external factors. Solving these problems requires not only rapid response but also a long-term, consistent, and balanced approach.

####### Media Coverage

### **[The Economy Appears to be Recovering, but This is an Illusion and Irony](https://youtu.be/Qnylq8qqEQQ)**

During the 2025 budget discussions in Parliament, Civil Contract MPs announced that there would be no salary and pension increases next year, while essential food prices are rising. In parallel, state debt will increase to a debt/GDP ratio of 54.6%. Economist Aghasi Tavadyan, founder of tvyal.com, shared his views on the risks of next year's budget and the government's policy that caused it in [Panorama-Interviews](https://www.panorama.am/am/news/2024/11/13/%D4%B1%D5%B2%D5%A1%D5%BD%D5%AB-%D4%B9%D5%A1%D5%BE%D5%A1%D5%A4%D5%B5%D5%A1%D5%B6/3077888).

</a>

Key points from the interview:

* This budget is problematic in several aspects. Mainly, revenues are continuously declining, leading to issues in state budget expenditures.
* The government claims they will ensure 7% economic growth for 50% growth over 6 years. While commendable, without real production to support long-term growth, this is problematic.
* Our economy relies on external money rather than production, achieving growth through the banking system, making it dependent on external rather than internal factors.
* Currently, about 70% of our exports - billions worth - is gold re-export, which distorted the picture.
* Economic growth figures (initially reported at 9.2%) created an illusion of recovery, but half of this growth came from gold re-exports. The figure was revised down to 6.4% and is likely to decrease further.
* Exports are declining across all directions: EAEU exports down 20%, EU exports down 25% (now only 3.6% of total).
* The government has lowered growth targets from 7% to 5.4% for next year, though even this remains optimistic.
* While the government has taken good steps in managing debt (over 50% in drams), risks remain, especially given the AMD's significant appreciation.
